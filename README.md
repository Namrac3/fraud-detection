## 🎯 Features

- **Real-Time Scoring:** Instant risk assessment for transactions on a 0-100 scale.  
- **Advanced Detection:** Identifies velocity fraud, geographic anomalies, and spending pattern deviations.  
- **Automated Alerts:** Configurable alerts for high-risk activities.  
- **Customer Profiling:** Analyzes individual customer behavior to establish baselines.  
- **Optimized Performance:** Efficient queries and proper indexing for speed.  
- **Enterprise-Ready:** Scripts for backup, maintenance, and security included.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- SQL Server 2016 or later (Express, Standard, or Enterprise)  
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) 18.0+  

## Open SSMS and run the script:

sql_scripts/fraud_detection_script.sql


This sets up the database, tables, and stored procedures.

## Verification

USE fraud_analytics;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM transactions;

-- Should return 8 sample records

## 📊 System Architecture

The system follows a three-tier architecture within SQL Server:

Data Layer: Core tables (transactions, cardholders, merchants, fraud_alerts)

Processing Layer: Stored procedures and views analyzing transactions in real time

Presentation Layer: Data for dashboards, alerts, and reports

## 🔍 Fraud Detection Capabilities

Pattern Recognition

Velocity Fraud: Flags multiple transactions in a short time

Geographic Anomalies: Detects impossible travel patterns

Amount Deviations: Statistical analysis (Z-score) identifies unusually large transactions

Time-Based Patterns: Flags transactions at unusual hours
