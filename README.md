SQL Server Fraud Detection System
A comprehensive, enterprise-grade fraud detection system built for SQL Server. This solution provides real-time transaction analysis, advanced pattern recognition, and automated alerting.

🎯 Features
Real-Time Scoring: Instant risk assessment for transactions on a 0-100 scale.

Advanced Detection: Identifies velocity fraud, geographic anomalies, and spending pattern deviations.

Automated Alerts: Configurable alerts for high-risk activities.

Customer Profiling: Analyzes individual customer behavior to establish baselines.

Optimized Performance: Uses efficient queries and proper indexing for speed.

Enterprise-Ready: Includes scripts for backup, maintenance, and security.

🚀 Quick Start

Prerequisites
SQL Server 2016 or later (Express, Standard, or Enterprise)

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) 18.0+

Installation
Clone this repository.

Open SSMS and run the script sql_scripts/fraud_detection_script.sql to set up the database, tables, and stored procedures.

Verification
USE fraud_analytics;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM transactions;
-- Should return 8 sample records

📊 System Architecture
The system operates on a simple, three-tier architecture within your SQL Server instance:

Data Layer: The core tables (transactions, cardholders, merchants, fraud_alerts) where all data resides.

Processing Layer: Contains the stored procedures and views that analyze transaction data and calculate risk scores in real time.

Presentation Layer: Provides the data for dashboards, alerts, and reports.

🔍 Fraud Detection Capabilities
Pattern Recognition
Our system uses several key patterns to identify suspicious activity:

Velocity Fraud: Flags multiple transactions in an unusually short time.

Geographic Anomalies: Detects impossible travel patterns (e.g., transactions in two distant states within minutes).

Amount Deviations: Uses statistical analysis (Z-score) to find transactions significantly larger than a customer's typical spending.

Time-Based Patterns: Identifies transactions occurring during unusual hours (e.g., late night/early morning).

Scoring Algorithm
Transactions are scored based on a multi-factor algorithm:

📈 Usage Examples
Basic Fraud Analysis
-- Get fraud overview by transaction amount
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN transaction_amount < 50 THEN 'Small (<$50)'
        WHEN transaction_amount BETWEEN 50 AND 500 THEN 'Medium ($50-$500)'
        ELSE 'Large (>$500)'
    END as amount_category,
    COUNT(*) as total_transactions,
    SUM(CAST(is_fraud AS INT)) as fraud_transactions,
    ROUND((SUM(CAST(is_fraud AS INT)) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)), 2) as fraud_percentage
FROM transactions
GROUP BY CASE 
    WHEN transaction_amount < 50 THEN 'Small (<$50)'
    WHEN transaction_amount BETWEEN 50 AND 500 THEN 'Medium ($50-$500)'
    ELSE 'Large (>$500)'
END
ORDER BY fraud_percentage DESC;

Real-Time Fraud Scoring
-- Score a new transaction
DECLARE @fraud_score INT;
EXEC CalculateFraudScore 
    @p_card_id = 'CARD001',
    @p_transaction_amount = 1500.00,
    @p_merchant_id = 'MERCH003',
    @p_location_state = 'CA',
    @p_transaction_time = '02:15:00',
    @fraud_score = @fraud_score OUTPUT;

SELECT 
    @fraud_score as fraud_score,
    CASE 
        WHEN @fraud_score >= 75 THEN 'HIGH RISK - Immediate Review'
        WHEN @fraud_score >= 50 THEN 'MEDIUM RISK - Monitor'
        WHEN @fraud_score >= 25 THEN 'LOW RISK - Normal Processing'
        ELSE 'MINIMAL RISK'
    END as risk_assessment;

🔒 Security Features
Role-based Access: Control access to sensitive data and procedures.

Data Encryption: Tables are designed for use with Transparent Data Encryption (TDE).

Audit Trail: Track all fraud investigation activities for compliance.

Input Validation: All procedures use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
